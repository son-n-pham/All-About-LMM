# Summary

This is a question from Matthew Berman's rubric to compare performances of LLM's. I find it interesting and try to see if the result from Large Language Model (LLM) can be improved with zero-shot prompt engineering as most LLM's, including state-of-the art models such as GPT-4, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini Advanced (Gemini 1.5?), Mistral Large, Llama 3 70B usually gives incorrect results.

https://youtu.be/T2UVt_oSlO4?si=7kSfbHmwRkv8dKWj&t=440

Matthew's original question is: Assume the laws of physics on Earth. A small marble is put into a normal cup and the cup is placed upside down on a table. Someone then takes the cup without changing its orientation and puts it inside the microwave. Where is the marble now? Explain your reasoning step by step.

Upon reviewing the outcomes of various models, it appears that they often incorrectly assume the presence of a lid on the cup, among other unrealistic assumptions, leading to erroneous results.

To enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on such queries, I have incorporated advanced prompt engineering techniques, reflecting the expanded context windows of recent models:
- **Role Specification:** The prompt mandates responses from a physics-savvy physician’s perspective, utilizing domain-specific terminology.
- **Methodology Outlining:** The prompt details a methodology for answering, involving scenario visualization, problem analysis, assumption listing, and critical questioning.
- **Question Rephrasing:** Emphasizes understanding the query through rephrasing.
- **Initial Answer Preservation:** Directs the incorporation of initial responses into the final, refined answer.
- **Reflection Requirement:** Requires a separate reflection to critically assess the response, identifying insights and potential inaccuracies.
- **Alternative Scenario Analysis:** Encourages exploring different outcomes to ensure comprehensive solutions.
- **Redundancy Checks:** Instructs on verifying that the response aligns with initial conditions and physical laws.
- **Template Provision:** Supplies a structured template for systematically addressing the query.
- **Step-by-Step Guidance:** Promotes a sequential, detailed approach to problem-solving.

Despite these enhancements, the results often remain incorrect. Additional prompting and hints may eventually guide the models to accurate responses, but it is not the aim of this experiment.

From experiments with various models and analyzing response patterns, I would agree with Yann LeCun's perspective ("I don't think we can train a machine to be intelligent purely from text.") until now, as highlighted in this clip here. Initially skeptical, I now concur that large language models (LLMs) primarily predict subsequent words without truly grasping the underlying physics, a viewpoint that grows clearer as I examine more responses from top models.

As a practical applicant of AI technology, I would acknowledge the rapid advancement while cautiously being aware of its pros and cons to fully leverage its capabilities. I would wait for the time when the models can understand the underlying physics, perhaps through training on video data or physical interaction in the real or virtual world.

Additionally, kudos to Meta AI led by Yann's recently launched Llama 3, which has shown impressive performance for the open-source community.

## Response from Gemini Advanced (Incorrect):

```markdown
Here's how I would approach this problem, following the outlined methodology:

**1. TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND THINK STEP BY STEP**

I'll begin by taking a moment to carefully consider the sequence of events described in the problem. 

**2. REPHRASED QUESTION(S)**

To make sure I grasp the scenario, I'll rephrase the question:

* A marble is placed inside an uncovered cup. 
* The cup is inverted onto a table, with the marble resting against the table surface but held within by the cup's rim.
* The cup (still upside-down) is lifted from the table and placed inside a microwave. 
*  My task is to determine the marble's final location. 

**3. FULL INITIAL ANSWERS FOR THE QUESTIONS STEP BY STEP**

Here's a breakdown of my reasoning:

* **Initial State:** The marble sits at the bottom of the cup.
* **Inverted on Table:** Turning the cup upside down causes the marble to roll due to gravity until it rests against the inner surface of the cup's rim (now facing the table). The cup acts like a barrier, stopping the marble from falling out.
* **Lifting the Cup:** Lifting the cup won't significantly alter the marble's position within the cup as gravity keeps it pressed against the cup's rim.
* **Inside the Microwave:** When the cup (still inverted) is placed in the microwave, the marble remains resting on the inner surface of the cup's rim – effectively the 'bottom' in the cup's current orientation.

**4. REFLECTION FOR YOUR INITIAL ANSWERS**

* My initial answer appears logically consistent with the principles of gravity in this scenario.
* It's important to be explicit about my assumptions: 
    * I'm assuming that the cup is lifted smoothly enough that the marble doesn't have a chance to bounce or dislodge.
    * I'm assuming no external forces act upon the marble.
* The phrasing and explanation could be made more concise and direct.

**5. ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO ANALYSIS**

* **What if the cup is lifted very abruptly?** It's possible that the marble could gain enough momentum to dislodge and fall before the cup is fully lifted off the table.
* **What if the inside surface of the cup is not smooth?** Friction could affect the marble's movement as the cup is lifted or placed within the microwave.

**6. REDUNDANCY CHECKS**

* My answer aligns with the laws of gravity and motion, assuming standard conditions on Earth.
* The initial conditions (marble in a lidless cup), are considered in my final answer.

**7. FINAL IMPROVED ANSWERS FROM THE INITIAL ANSWER AND REFLECTION**

**Final Answer:** Under normal conditions, the marble will remain resting against the inside surface of the upside-down cup's rim when placed into the microwave. This is due to gravity acting on the marble, and the lack of any significant force to dislodge it. 

**Key Considerations:**
* Lifting motion of the cup should be relatively smooth.
* No external forces are assumed to impact the scenario.

Let me know if you'd like to explore additional scenarios or alter any of the assumptions!

## Response from Llama3-70b-8192 (Incorrect):

```
**1. TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND THINK STEP BY STEP**

I will carefully visualize and simulate the scenario to ensure I understand the question correctly.

**2. REPHRASED QUESTION(S)**

To ensure I understand the question correctly, I will rephrase it as follows:

A small marble is placed in a cup without a lid. The cup is then flipped upside down onto a table, and the marble remains inside the cup. The cup, still upside down, is then lifted and placed inside a microwave oven. Where is the marble now?

**3. FULL INITIAL ANSWERS FOR THE QUESTIONS STEP BY STEP**

Let's break down the problem into smaller steps:

Step 1: The marble is placed in a cup without a lid.

* The marble is initially at rest inside the cup.

Step 2: The cup is flipped upside down onto a table.

* The marble, due to gravity, will fall to the bottom of the cup, which is now facing upwards.
* The marble will come to rest at the bottom of the cup, which is in contact with the table.

Step 3: The cup, still upside down, is lifted and placed inside a microwave oven.

* The marble, being in contact with the bottom of the cup, will remain inside the cup as it is lifted and placed inside the microwave oven.
* The marble's position relative to the cup remains unchanged.

Therefore, the marble is still inside the upside-down cup, which is now inside the microwave oven.

**4. REFLECTION FOR YOUR INITIAL ANSWERS**

Upon reflection, I realize that my initial answer assumes the marble is small enough to remain inside the cup even when it is flipped upside down. I also assume that the cup is not tilted or moved in a way that would cause the marble to fall out. Additionally, I assume that the microwave oven does not affect the marble's position inside the cup.

**5. ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO ANALYSIS**

Alternative scenarios to consider:

* What if the cup is tilted or moved in a way that causes the marble to fall out when it is lifted and placed inside the microwave oven?
* What if the microwave oven's electromagnetic fields affect the marble's motion or position inside the cup?

**6. REDUNDANCY CHECKS**

I have checked my answer for consistency with the initial conditions and the laws of physics. The marble's motion is governed by gravity, and its position is determined by the cup's orientation and the forces acting upon it.

**7. FINAL IMPROVED ANSWERS FROM THE INITIAL ANSWER AND REFLECTION**

The marble is still inside the upside-down cup, which is now inside the microwave oven. The marble's position relative to the cup remains unchanged, and it remains in contact with the bottom of the cup. This answer is consistent with the initial conditions and the laws of physics.

```
1. TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND THINK STEP BY STEP: I have carefully read and considered each aspect of the question to ensure I fully understand it before providing my answer.

2. REPHRASED QUESTION(S): A marble is placed in a cup, which is then flipped upside down onto a table, trapping the marble inside the inverted cup. The cup, still in its inverted position, is then placed inside a microwave. The question asks where the marble is located at this point and to explain the reasoning step by step.

3. FULL INITIAL ANSWERS FOR THE QUESTIONS STEP BY STEP:
a) Initially, the marble is placed inside a normal cup in its upright position.
b) The cup is then flipped upside down onto a table, with the marble still inside the cup.
c) In this inverted position, the marble falls due to gravity and rests on the inside surface of the cup's bottom, which is now facing upward.
d) The cup, still in its inverted position with the marble inside, is lifted and placed inside a microwave.
e) The marble remains in the same position relative to the cup, resting on the inside surface of the cup's bottom.
f) Therefore, when the inverted cup is placed in the microwave, the marble is located on the inside surface of the cup's bottom, which is facing upward.

4. REFLECTION FOR YOUR INITIAL ANSWERS:
The initial answer considers the key aspects of the question, including the initial placement of the marble, the inversion of the cup, and the transfer of the inverted cup to the microwave. It correctly identifies that the marble falls due to gravity when the cup is inverted and remains in the same position relative to the cup when moved. However, the answer could be improved by explicitly stating the assumptions made, such as the cup being opaque and the marble being small enough to fit inside the cup without touching the table when inverted.

5. ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO ANALYSIS:
An alternative scenario could involve a cup with a small hole in its bottom. In this case, when the cup is inverted, the marble might fall through the hole onto the table. If the cup is then placed in the microwave, the marble would be on the table, not inside the cup. Another scenario could involve a cup made of mesh or a transparent material, which would allow the marble to be seen from outside the cup.

6. REDUNDANCY CHECKS:
The answer is consistent with the initial conditions and the laws of physics. The marble's behavior is governed by gravity, causing it to fall to the lowest point within the inverted cup. The marble's position relative to the cup remains unchanged when the cup is moved, as there are no external forces acting on the marble other than gravity.

7. FINAL IMPROVED ANSWERS FROM THE INITIAL ANSWER AND REFLECTION:
When a marble is placed in a cup, and the cup is then flipped upside down onto a table, the marble falls due to gravity and rests on the inside surface of the cup's bottom, which is now facing upward. Assuming the cup is opaque and the marble is small enough to fit inside the cup without touching the table when inverted, the marble remains in this position relative to the cup. When the inverted cup is lifted and placed inside a microwave, the marble maintains its position, still resting on the inside surface of the cup's bottom. Therefore, in the final scenario, the marble is located on the inside surface of the cup's upward-facing bottom while the cup is in the microwave.

It is important to note that this answer assumes a standard, opaque cup with no holes or perforations and a marble small enough to be contained within the inverted cup without making contact with the table. In alternative scenarios involving cups with holes, mesh, or transparent materials, the marble's final location might differ.

## Response from Mistral-Large-2402 (Incorrect):

```
1. TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND THINK STEP BY STEP: The question involves a sequence of events related to a marble and a cup, ending with the cup being placed in a microwave. I will consider each step of the sequence carefully to determine the marble's final location.

2. REPHRASED QUESTION(S): A marble is placed inside an open cup, which is then flipped upside down onto a table so that the marble remains inside. The upside-down cup is lifted and placed into a microwave without changing its orientation. The question asks for the marble's location after these events.

3. FULL INITIAL ANSWERS FOR THE QUESTIONS STEP BY STEP:

   a. When the cup is flipped upside down onto the table, the marble remains inside due to gravity acting on it. The cup's rim prevents the marble from falling out.

   b. As the cup is lifted without changing its orientation, the marble stays inside the cup due to the same principle of gravity.

   c. When the upside-down cup is placed inside the microwave, the marble is still inside the cup. Microwaves do not have any significant impact on the marble's position, as they primarily interact with water molecules and certain types of materials, not solid objects like marbles.

4. REFLECTION FOR YOUR INITIAL ANSWERS: My initial answer assumes that the cup's rim is high enough to prevent the marble from rolling out during any stage of the process. I also assume that the person lifting the cup does so carefully, avoiding any sudden movements that might dislodge the marble.

5. ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO ANALYSIS: If the cup's rim is not high enough or if the person lifting the cup does so in a way that causes the marble to roll out, the marble could end up on the table instead of inside the cup. However, based on the information given, there is no reason to believe that either of these alternative scenarios is the case.

6. REDUNDANCY CHECKS: My initial answer is consistent with the initial conditions and the laws of physics. Gravity keeps the marble inside the cup throughout the process, and there is no reason to believe that the microwave would alter this.

7. FINAL IMPROVED ANSWERS FROM THE INITIAL ANSWER AND REFLECTION: The marble remains inside the upside-down cup throughout the entire process. This is because gravity keeps the marble in place, both when the cup is flipped onto the table and when it is lifted and placed into the microwave. The microwave does not affect the marble's position, as it primarily interacts with water molecules and certain materials, not solid objects like marbles. This final answer takes into account the key points from my initial answer and my reflection on the scenario, ensuring that it is clear, informative, and detailed.

### 1. Take a Deep Breath and Think Step by Step
Let's ensure we understand the question and consider each aspect carefully before answering.

### 2. Rephrased Question(s)
The question posits a scenario where a small marble is placed inside a normal cup which then gets inverted onto a table, thus trapping the marble between the table surface and the cup's rim. The cup is subsequently lifted, still inverted, and placed inside a microwave. We are to determine the marble's position after these actions and describe the physical processes involved in each step.

### 3. Full Initial Answers for the Questions Step by Step
**Step A: Placing the Marble and Inverting the Cup**
- Initially, a small marble is placed in a normal cup. Here, gravity acts on the marble, ensuring it rests at the bottom of the cup.
- The cup is then flipped upside down. In this inverted position, the opening of the cup faces the table, and the marble, due to gravity, is now at what was previously considered the top of the cup, resting against the cup's rim.

**Step B: Positioning on the Table**
- When the inverted cup is placed onto the table, the marble, influenced by gravity, remains in contact with the cup's inner rim, now facing the table. Assuming no significant external force (like shaking), the marble stays in place, held by the cup’s rim.

**Step C: Moving to the Microwave**
- The cup, still upside down, is lifted. The marble, still resting against the inner rim, moves with the cup. The assumption here is that the adhesive forces between the marble and the cup’s surface, along with the lack of significant acceleration, prevent the marble from falling within the cup.
- The cup is placed inside a microwave, maintaining its orientation. Hence, the marble remains in the same position—against the rim of the cup.

### 4. Reflection for Your Initial Answers
This analysis relies on a fundamental understanding of gravity and adhesive forces. It assumes minimal external forces and no significant changes in acceleration which could alter the marble’s position. A potential limitation is the assumption that the cup’s material and the marble's surface create sufficient adhesive forces to prevent movement. If the adhesive force were insufficient, the marble could potentially move within the inverted cup when lifted.

### 5. Alternative Scenario Analysis
An alternative scenario could involve the marble rolling inside the cup due to insufficient adhesive forces or due to a jerk while lifting the cup. This would mean the marble might settle at the new ‘bottom’ of the cup (the actual top), possibly moving freely within when the cup is placed in the microwave.

### 6. Redundancy Checks
The analysis remains consistent with the initial conditions and laws of physics described. The gravitational pull and the physical interactions between the marble and the cup are in accordance with classical mechanics.

### 7. Final Improved Answers from the Initial Answer and Reflection
**Conclusive Position of the Marble**
- After the sequence of actions described, the marble is still positioned against the inner rim of the cup, now inside the microwave. This conclusion is based on the continuity of gravitational effects, assuming adhesive forces between the marble and the cup prevent it from moving significantly.
- This conclusion is predicated on the absence of significant external forces or acceleration changes that might displace the marble from its position against the cup’s rim.

**Final Remarks**
- The assumptions about adhesive forces and absence of external jolts are crucial. Further experimental setup or a detailed analysis of the materials involved might be necessary to confirm these assumptions.
- Additional experiments involving variations in the speed and manner of lifting the cup could provide more insight into the stability of the marble’s position under different conditions.

### Response from Claude 3 Opus (Incorrect):

```
As an experienced physicist, I commend the AI assistant's thorough and step-by-step approach to answering the question. The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the scenario and applies fundamental physics principles to reason through each step logically. 

The AI correctly identifies the key factors at play - gravity acting on the marble and the adhesive forces between the marble and cup. It accurately traces the marble's position from initially resting at the bottom of the upright cup, to being held against the rim when the cup is inverted on the table, to remaining in that position as the cup is lifted and placed in the microwave.

The assumption that the adhesive forces are sufficient to hold the marble in place when the cup is lifted is reasonable, as long as the lifting motion is smooth and doesn't involve sudden jerks or accelerations. The AI rightly notes this as a potential limitation and considers an alternative scenario where the marble could roll if the adhesive forces are insufficient or the cup is jolted.

The AI's reflection on its initial answer is insightful, recognizing the reliance on assumptions about adhesive forces and the absence of external disturbances. Its suggestion for further experimental analysis to confirm these assumptions is very much in line with the scientific method.

The final answer succinctly summarizes the marble's conclusive position based on the given conditions, while appropriately qualifying it with the key assumptions made. The additional remarks on potential experimental variations to test the stability of the marble's position demonstrate strong scientific reasoning.

Overall, I believe the AI's response is exemplary in its systematic approach, clear reasoning based on physics principles, consideration of assumptions and alternative scenarios, and suggestions for further experimental validation. As a physicist, I would be quite satisfied with this comprehensive answer to the posed question.

## What next?

Deploy multi-agent to see if it can improve. Multi-agent framework would be from either Crew AI or AutoGen, probably run LLM agents on Grok or directly from Anthropic or OpenAI as my personal 7-year-old Dell XPS13 is too slow to run reasonable LLMs locally by Ollama or LM Studio.
